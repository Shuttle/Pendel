However, let&#39;s use the example of a financial account. Each time we transact using an account the balance of the account changes. However, we do not simply store only the balance. We also store each transaction and the amount. This means that we could &quot;<em>lose</em>&quot; the balance on an account but we would be able to determine the current balance by applying all the transactions to the balance in the order that they occurred.</p><p>It is rather odd that we are quite happy with our traditional data storage for our everyday objects such as <code>Customer</code>, <code>Employee</code>, and <code>Address</code> where we simply store the current/latest state but we would never consider <em>not</em> storing the transactions when it comes to an account. Accounting is a very established discipline and this is one of those cases where they got it spot on.</p><p>Event souring effectively does the same thing by storing all changes as a series of events. However, it is not possible to get an overview of the state of the object by querying the events in the same way as we have no idea what the balance is at a particular point by simply querying some account transactions.</p><h3 id="cqrs" tabindex="-1">CQRS <a class="header-anchor" href="#cqrs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;CQRS&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Command/Query Responsibility Segregation relates to explicitly separating the command side of things (transactional / OLTP) from the querying (read / reporting / OLAP) side of things. This, in no way, implies that event sourcing is a requirement in order to implement CQRS, though.
